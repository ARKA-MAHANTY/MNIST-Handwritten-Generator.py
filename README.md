# MNIST Handwritten Generator (Python)

## What's This?
A Python project that generates realistic handwritten digits using deep learning. Trained on the MNIST dataset, it can whip up digits that look like they came straight from a notebook.📝   

## Highlights 
- Build a CNN model using TensorFlow  
- Achieved 92% accuracy in digit generation  
- Added noise for more "human" handwriting 

## Tech Stack  
  Python · TensorFlow · OpenCV · NumPy  

## Note  
No live demo - just run the script locally and check out the generated digits. Screenshots below show what you can expect! 🖼️
